### So you'd like to enable the Signal Mountain Bible Church Alexa Skill... well you've come to the right place!

<!--more-->

#### There are two main methods to enable the skill: 1) Enable in the Skill Market via the Alexa app 2) Enable via the Amazon Website. We will cover both.

#### Caution
The account that the device is registered to must be the account that enables the skill. For example: If Joe bought an Echo Dot and wants to use the SMBC skill and he asked his wife, Sally to enable the skill. If she enables from her account (and they aren't set up as a Family account), Joe won't be able to use the skill on his registered device. The easiest way to solve this problem is to either 1) have one person buy all of the devices and handle all of the skill enabling or 2) set up your accounts as a Family account in Amazon (and even this I think is not foolproof)

### Enable via the Skill Market via the Alexa app

First step is to ensure you have the Alexa app and are signed in.

On Android, the Alexa app can be downloaded here: [Android Alexa App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app "Android Alexa App")

On iPhone, the Alexa app can be downloaded here: [iTunes Alexa App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-alexa/id944011620 "iTunes Alexa App")

Once the app is installed, log-in using your standard Amazon credentials. Note: The images below are from an Android device and may be different for iPhones.

Once you are logged into the Alexa app it should look something like this:
