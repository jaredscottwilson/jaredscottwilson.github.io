_Why One Hundred Miles..._

One late summer evening in 2019 on my phone watching Billy Yang's video "The Why". 

Listening to a muffled Ken Chlouber and the future Leadville 100 runners yelling I COMMIT, I WON'T QUIT. 

Listening to Billy narrate "_I often wonder, is there something in our DNA that strangely finds comfort in this discomfort._".
